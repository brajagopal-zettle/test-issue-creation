# test-issue-creation

- Make some changes and raise PR
- Once the PR build is completed and reviewed, merge the PR
- After PR merge, an issue is created with list of all the commits from the last release tag
- If an issue already exists, then it is closed and a new one is created
- All the contributors are notified in slack. This is yet to be implemented
